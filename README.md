## **Introduction**

---

I just graduated with my master's degree in Computer Science. I enjoyed all my classes while pursuing the degree, but I always wanted to share the posts, my thoughts, and reviews on books because you will definitely forget about those later on. 

Who am I ?

* I have played the drum since 6<sup>th</sup> grade and played guitar for 2 years. 
* I like to watch movies because I can gain indirect experiences, rather reading a whole book.
* I have taught C/C++ since 2019. I had a wonderful experience with students and their input for the projects.
* Interestingly, my bachelor degree was in Electrical Engineering, and I have reasonable doubts on how I was able to pass all the exam.

What I am really interested in ?

* I am interested in Deep Learning in Computer Vision Application.
* Within Computer Vision Application, I am eager to learn `3D Reconstruction`, `Depth Estimation`, and `Visual-SLAM`.
