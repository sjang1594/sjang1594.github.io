## Work Life Logs.

Ever since I've been working in self-driving car industry. I learn that there are vast information I need to digest so that I can contribute a little smidge of it. But I became somewhat software engineer though in terms of good aspect of working for current company. I've been reflecting myself a lot these days that I hate to work on some project that I am not interested in. This might be a true fact for everyone, but it apply to me espacially. Also, the other thing I realize myself was that I get impacted easily by people I work with. At my current job, a lot of people are leaving including my team lead and project lead. It's very sad that it's happening so fastly like that. I am now able to move to different industry or job. 

I am at the point where I should consider what my career to be in next 10 years.
