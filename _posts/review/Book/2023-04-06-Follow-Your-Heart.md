### Follow Your Heart

The reason why I purchase this book was a random decision that I made while taking the subway. I can't really recall when it was, but i was having some sad moments for sure. It took an while to read this book because this type of book takes a lot of time for me, and it just too obvious how the story will move along. The main character this book struggle some kind of neuralogical disorder. I am not quite sure name of disorder to be honest.
