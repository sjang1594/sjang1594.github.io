### Motivation

I’m currently working on my own game engine, called Luna Game Engine. Sometimes, the workload can feel overwhelming, especially when balancing personal projects and portfolio building. I find that taking a break and reflecting helps me maintain focus and productivity.

While working on Luna, I often draw inspiration from existing game engines like Unreal Engine, Unity, and FrostBite. Each of these engines has a distinct philosophy and approach to game development. For example, Unity is particularly focused on multi-platform support, which makes it versatile for mobile, console, and desktop applications. There’s a great video on YouTube that outlines Unity’s roadmap and how they plan to evolve the engine.

One remarkable feature of Unreal Engine is its support for large-scale triangle meshes through Nanite. However, I am a bit concerned about the runtime performance when loading these heavy meshes. While the visuals are undeniably impressive, maintaining performance is always a critical consideration.

Unity’s collaboration with Zyva is also noteworthy, especially when it comes to realistic facial animations. The demo shows incredibly vivid muscle movements that mimic human expressions. This kind of technology could significantly impact the VR industry and even healthcare applications.

Personally, I have a soft spot for FrostBite, as I have enjoyed the Battlefield series for years. I also find it fascinating how the engine has evolved, especially for FIFA. In older versions, scoring from long-distance shots was quite easy, but recent iterations have introduced more nuanced physics and player attributes, making gameplay more realistic. Small details, like players sweating, might seem minor, but they reflect just how far game engines have come in terms of visual fidelity and realism.

As I continue developing Luna Game Engine, I aim to incorporate some of the strengths I admire in these established engines while maintaining my own vision. Taking time to study how industry leaders approach engine design helps me make more informed decisions about Luna's features and structure.
