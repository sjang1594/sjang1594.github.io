## Motivation
Firstly, Let's look at the diagram below, Forward Rendering (in this case specific, this is not forward rendering/deferrered rendering context, this just shows the computer graphics and computer vision=inverse rendering) is what we learn from Computer Graphics, such as PBR. Inverse Rendering application, for instance, might be 3D reconstruction and motion capture, etc.
