## Differential Geometry Introduction
Roughly Speaking, classical differential geometry is the study of local properties of curves and surface. By local properties we mean those properties which depend only on the behavior of the curve or surface in the neighborhood of a point. (Differential Calculus), so the curves and the surfaces considered in dg will be defined by functions which can be diffeerentiated a certain number of times. The other aspect is the so-called global differential geometry. All the influence impacted by the local properties of curve and surface is so called global differential geometry.
