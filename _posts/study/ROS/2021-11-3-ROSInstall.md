## ROS Environment Setup in MacOS

Iâ€™ve researched a little bit about how to set up a ROS environment in MacOS Big Sur. If you have Catalina or an older version of MacOS, I saw that it might work. But I already have a newer version of MacOS, and I do not want to downgrade my OS right now because I am lazy. Also, I have tried to follow the instructions on ROS webpage for both [Foxy](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Installation/macOS-Install-Binary.html) and the newer version [Galactic]. As I am a software engineer, I felt obligated to solve the ways to install ROS2 on the MacOS, but if you are interested in "How to set up a ROS environment in MacOS. Please read this before you attempt to do it [MacOS ROS2 Galatic](https://discourse.ros.org/t/macos-support-in-ros-2-galactic-and-beyond/17891/2)

Then, what would be the workaround to set up the ROS environment.

### **Docker**

There is a ros for docker. It depends on what ROS version you want to install. There are whole version of ros in this [link]()

### **Virtual Machine (VM)**

As you may heard, sometimes you may need a different OS to build an envieronment with different platforms. Esepcially, you might need VM for setting up the ROS environment.

1. First, install ubuntu 20.04 in order for you to set up the ROS2.
