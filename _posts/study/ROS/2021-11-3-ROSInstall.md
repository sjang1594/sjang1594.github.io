# Title : ROS Environment Setup in MacOS

Iâ€™ve researched a little bit about how to set up a ROS environment in MacOS Big Sur. If you have Catalina or an older version of MacOS, I saw that it might work. But I already have a newer version of MacOS, and I do not want to downgrade my OS right now because I am lazy. Also, I have tried to follow the instructions on ROS webpage for both [Foxy](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Installation/macOS-Install-Binary.html) and the newer version [Galactic]. As I am a software engineer, I felt obligated to solve the ways to install ROS2 on the MacOS, but if you are interested in "How to set up a ROS environment in MacOS. Please read this before you attempt to do it [MacOS ROS2 Galatic](https://discourse.ros.org/t/macos-support-in-ros-2-galactic-and-beyond/17891/2) 

Then, what would be the workaround to set up the ROS environment.
